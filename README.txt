This Rails app is intended to create a cycling schedule for house chores. If someone does not report their assigned chore, they will be publicly shamed.

Scaffolds:
chore - a chore field with a person to whom the chore is assigned; a boolean indicating whether or not it is finished; the date it was added; the date it was finished.
	<root>/chores
chorefinished - a field with the person who finished the chore; the date it was finished; a box for comments.
	<root>/chore_finishes
